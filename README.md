For this project, I obtained, debugged, and processed a dataset to create a customized dashboard in Google Data Studio.

### The sources of data used in this project were:

✔️ Orders file: orders.csv

✔️ Google Sheets: bbdd_integrador.gsheet

### The client requested the following information to be displayed on the dashboard:

✔️ Total number of orders

✔️ Total sales amount

✔️ Sales by article

✔️ Total sales amount by article and category

✔️ Total sales amount by month

✔️ Number of customers

✔️ Number of countries

✔️ Top 5 customers and their total sales amounts

✔️ Top 5 countries and their total sales amounts

✔️ Top 5 customers by country and their total amounts

✔️ Top 5 countries with their customers and total amounts

### Features

✔️ The customer's requests were addressed through dynamic data visualizations that allow for selection, filtering, and detailed information display on hover.

✔️ A simple yet visually appealing design was used to present the data.

✔️ The dashboard allows filtering by time period, article and/or country.

✔️ Result cards were also used to display specific information.

✔️ For measuring different dimensions, bar plots were utilized and plotted horizontally for easier label reading.

✔️ Dynamic tables with filters were used to provide more detailed information.

### Resources used
